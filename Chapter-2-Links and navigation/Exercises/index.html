        <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
        <p>Eddie and Venom are still on the run after their recent battle with Carnage, and the murder of Mulligan makes it into the headlines with Eddie being named as the prime suspect,
            which makes him want to set out to New York and wipe out his name, but unknowingly, they leave a hint of Venom's bits at the bar. Later on, a creature known as the Xenophage had begun tracking
            Venom and Eddie. Earlier developments outline the interest of a soldier in charge of Imperium named Rex Strickland who's aim is to capture and study the symbiotes landed on Earth.
            Rex retrieves a sample of Venom earlier in the Mexican bar and with only three days left before decommissioning Area 51, all equipment is being dissolved with acid.
            Mulligan, who survived his encounter with Carnage, is taken after being left for dead by another symbiote. He is bonded with one of many contained symbiotes and is questioned by two Imperium researchers Dr. Teddy Paine and Dr. Sadie to learn about the Symbiotes' purpose on Earth.
            He states that he can see images of his God (Knull) sending down Xenophages to hunt for the symbiotes.</p>
        <p>
            While attaching themselves to the side of an airplane travelling to New York, Eddie and Venom are attached by The Xenophage tracking them down and are forced to drop off at Nevada Desert.
            Thats when Venom explains Eddie that Xenophages were sent down by Knull to hunt for the Codex, which is created when a Symbiote resurrects his dead host. This can free Knull from his prison in Klyntar that the symbiotes trapped him in long ago.
            Since Venom revived Eddie before, they now carry a Codex. After being almost hunted by Strickland and his team, Eddie meets a family of travellers who offer him a free ride to Area 51.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, Mulligan's symbiote states that if Knull gains freedom, he will destroy all life in the universe and that he can't be killed since he is older than the universe itself.
            This makes Strickland decide to kill Eddie in order to save the universe.
        </p>
        <p>
            After arriving in Las Vegas, Eddie and Venom enter a casino in order to get some money but Venom spends all of Eddie's money carelessly. A few moments later, they run into Ms. Chen in which Venom shares a dance with her before getting ambushed by the Xenophage again.
            Just a moment later, Strickland's team seperates Venom from Eddie and takes him into Area 51 where Eddie meets Mulligan once more. 
            Mulligan's Symbiote explains Eddie that the base has an army of symbiotes that can help him fight the Xenophages and protect the Codex. Sadie frees Venom, who re-bonds with Eddie after Strickland shoots him.
            This attracts the Xenophage to the base, and Mulligan is killed in battle.

        </p>
        <p>
            Martin's family was at the Area 51 base when the battle broke out, fulfilling his dream of seeing some aliens.
            Venom has other contained symbiotes released, which bond with Sadie and other doctors to fight off the Xenophag, who has signaled to Knull that the Codex has been found.
            Knull sends more Xenophages through portals to Earth, overwhelming the Symbiotes. 
            Realizing he must sacrifice himself to destroy the Codex and save the universe, Venom merges with the Xenophages, leads them into acid tanks, and bids Eddie farewell before ejecting him as a mortally wounded Strickland sets off his grenades to destroy them.
            Teddy bonds with a Symbiote to save Sadie from the explosion while Eddie falls unconscious as the base burns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eddie later wakes up in a hospital, where a military official informs him that his actions with Venom at Area 51 have earned him a relief, under the condition of keeping everything that happened as a secret. Arriving in New York City, Eddie gazes at the Statue of Liberty while remembering Venom.
        </p>
        <p>
            Knull declares that the universe is no longer safe from him now that Venom has fallen. The bartender, who was taken into custody by Strickland shortly after Eddie left for New York, escapes the burned remains of Area 51. Nearby, a black cockroach crawls out of the rubble next to a broken vial that previously contained a sample of the Venom Symbiote.

        <p id="reviewheading"><b>"Made me tear up" - jacksongaming</b></p>
        <p id="review1">My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.
            This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.
        </p>
        <p id="reviewheading"><b>"Fun watch, as long as you don't expect too much from it" - proli</b></p>
        <p id="review2">Venom 3 is a fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be rated that way. Its fun, its weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.</p>
        <p id="reviewheading"><b>"I expected a dumb, fun movie, and that's exactly what I got. Why are y'all hating!?" - Evanparker</b></p>
        <p id="review3">Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you. This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.</p>
